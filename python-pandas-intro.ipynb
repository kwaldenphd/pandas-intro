    "## Lab Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab covers the core components of `pandas`, including `Series` and `DataFrame` objects. It covers how to manually create and interact with `Series` and `DataFrame` objects in the Python programming environment. It covers loading a structured data file (CSV and JSON) as a `DataFrame`, and sorting, selecting, and filtering the resulting `DataFrame`. The lab also covers common data parsing and wrangling challenges like duplicate entries and missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, students will be able to;\n",
    "- Understand the basic components of `Series` and `DataFrame` objects in `pandas`\n",
    "- Manually create `Series` and `DataFrame` objects in Python using `pandas`\n",
    "- Load a structured data file as a `DataFrame` in Python using `pandas`\n",
    "- Interact with a `DataFrame` using sorting, selecting, and filtering operations\n",
    "- Remove duplicate rows from a `DataFrame`\n",
    "- Understand how to approach common `DataFrame` parsing and loading errors using `pandas`\n",
    "- Understand the basic components of how to handle missing values in a `DataFrame`\n",

    "# What do we mean by pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Some of you may be wondering why we are talking about pandas in a computer science course.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is a panda?\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://github.com/kwaldenphd/pandas-intro/blob/main/Figure_2.png?raw=true\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://github.com/kwaldenphd/pandas-intro/blob/main/Figure_2.png?raw=true\" /></a></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Panda: \"a large black-and-white mammal (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) of chiefly central China that feeds primarily on bamboo shoots and is now usually classified with the bears (family Ursidae)\" ([Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/panda))\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Wait that's not right....\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `pandas`: \"a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language\" ([`pandas` documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/))\n",
    "\n",
    "6. That makes more sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. If you remember back to our earlier work with `.csv` files in Python, there are limitations to the kinds of things we can do with structured data using the `csv` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Particularly if we want to analyze and visualze structured data in a Python programming environment, we aren't going to get very far loading `csv` files as lists or dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. We need Python to understand or interact with structured data as structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Enter `pandas`.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Software developers at AQR Capital Management began working on a Python-based tool (written in a combination of C and Python) for quantitative data analysis in 2008.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. The initial open-source version of `pandas` was released in 2008.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. At its core, \"`pandas` is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series\" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandas_(software)).\n",
    "\n",
    "14. The name `pandas` is derived from \"panel data,\" an econometrics term used to describe particular types of datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. The name `pandas` is also a play on \"Python data analysis.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "16. For more on the history and origins of `pandas`, check out Wes McKinney's [\"pandas: a Foundational Python Library for Data Analysis and Statistics\"](https://www.dlr.de/sc/Portaldata/15/Resources/dokumente/pyhpc2011/submissions/pyhpc2011_submission_9.pdf) 2011 paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. `pandas` is based on and has some similarities with another Python package, `NumPy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. According to [package documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/whatisnumpy.html), \"`NumPy` is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "19. In `NumPy`, data are stored as list-like objects called arrays. \n",
    "\n",
    "20. `NumPy` allows users to access, split, reshape, join, etc. data stored in arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. `pandas` takes a similar approach to structured data, or data organized in a tabular (i.e. table-like) format.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. \"pandas adopts significant parts of NumPy's idiomatic style of array-based computing, especially array-based functions and a preference for data processing without for loops...the biggest difference is that pandas is designed for working with tabular or heterogeneous data. NumPy, by contrast, is best suited for working with homogenous numerical array data\" (Wes McKinney, Chapter 5 \"Getting Started with Pandas\" in *Python for Data Analysis*, pg. 125)\n",

    "# Data structures in `pandas`\n",
    "\n",
    "24. `pandas` has two main data structures: `Series` and `DataFrame`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## `Series`\n",
    "\n",
    "25. In `pandas`, \"a `Series` is a one-dimensional, array-like object containing a sequence of values...and an associated array of data labels, called its index\" (McKinney, 126).\n",
    "\n",
    "26. At first glance, a `Series` looks a lot like a Python list."
